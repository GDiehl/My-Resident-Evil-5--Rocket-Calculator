My Resident Evil 5:  Rocket Calculator 1.1.0.3

A simple application to calculate level times in the Resident Evil 5 game
to determine if you have reached the five hour requirement to unlock the
infinite rocket launchers.  If you’ve exceeded the five hour requirement 
the program will tell you how much time you need to shave off.  

Change Log:
1.0 - Initial release.  Simple calculator worked, nothing more.
1.1 - Got the save function to work.  Now it saves all your input data when you close it and enters it all in again on next load.  Plus fixed a few minor bugs.
